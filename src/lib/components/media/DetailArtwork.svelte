	 * is free to ignore; it picks a resolution from bandwidth and viewport, and
	 * nothing an embedder passes overrides that. The viewer can still choose one
	 * by hand — the gear menu is YouTube's own and is already there.
	 *
	 * - `playsinline` keeps the trailer inside the sheet on iOS, which otherwise
	 *   throws every embed into the system fullscreen player and drops the viewer
	 *   out of the sheet they were reading.
	 * - `controls` is the default, stated so a future edit has to mean it.
	 * - `cc_load_policy` turns captions on where the video has them.
	 * - `modestbranding` and `rel` keep the end of a trailer from turning into a
	 *   grid of somebody else's uploads.
