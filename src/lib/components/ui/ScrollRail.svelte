	 * swipes sideways and a phone drags, so the gap is invisible on the machines
	 * this tends to get built on and total on a desktop with a wheel mouse: the
	 * cards to the right simply cannot be reached.
	 *
	 * So the arrows are not decoration, they are the control. They appear only in
	 * the direction there is something to reach, which also makes them the
	 * indicator of how far along the row you are.
	 *
	 * Shared by every rail rather than written per row: the affordance, the edge
	 * fade and the snap padding all have to agree, and three of those were already
	 * wrong in one copy and right in another.
