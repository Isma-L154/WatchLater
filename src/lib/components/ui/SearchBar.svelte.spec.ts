 * What happens to text that was already in the box when this component woke up.

 * The box is server-rendered, so somebody can type into it seconds before the
 * script that makes it search has loaded. Svelte's binding adopts that text,
 * which looks like everything is fine — but no `oninput` ever fired, so nothing
 * was ever searched. The page then switches to the results view and reports
 * "no results" for a search it never ran: a wrong answer rather than a slow one.
