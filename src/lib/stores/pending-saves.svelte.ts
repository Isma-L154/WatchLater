 * every navigation and every invalidation, and a second copy of it in the
 * browser would be a second truth free to drift from the first. So this is not
 * a copy: it is a thin layer of *intent* laid over the loader's data and torn
 * down the moment real data replaces it. A key is in here only while its
 * request is in flight, which is measured in hundreds of milliseconds.
 *
 * Keys are `mediaKey` strings, so a title flips everywhere it is on screen at
 * once — the trending grid, a recommendation rail and the open detail sheet
 * can all be showing the same title, and only one of them was clicked.
